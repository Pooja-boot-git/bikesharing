# Overview: 
This project helps you understand how CitiBikes are doing in New York City. We strive to gain understanding of this data by doing statistical analysis so that we can decide if the same bike sharing model would work in Des Moines, Iowa. For the purpose of this analysis, we have used data for the month of August.

## Analysis:
Following visualizations have been created. 
1. Checkout durations
2. Checkout durations by gender
3. Starttimes have been plotted against days of the week
4. Starttimes have been plotted against weekdays with an added filter of gender
5. User Types(Customer/Subscriber) and weekday against gender
6. Geographical graph has been created using the latitude/longitude information
7. Peak hours calculated for month of August 

### Results:
- Refer to Tableau Online link to view all the seven visualizations in detail. Skip to the **CitiBike Story** tab to understand key information extracted for each viz.
- Each of the stories have description underneath.

## Key takeaways:
- Bike sharing is mostly used for short duration rides.
- Males have higher bike usage than females.
- Bike sharing is more popular in areas that have population with ages in between 21 to 40 years.
- 5PM-6PM is the peak hour given that's the end of day for most people. Timings of usage lean towards the possibility that people are using bike sharing to work.

### Summary:
- As per 2010 census, the median age in the city of Des Moines, Iowa was 33.5 years. 24.8% of residents were under the age of 18; 10.9% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 29.4% were from 25 to 44; 23.9% were from 45 to 64; and 11% were 65. 
- Citi Bikes is covering more area compared to Des Moines, Iowa including Manhattan and Brooklyn and is still very successful.
- Given the above details, we can look further into Des Moines data to come to a conclusion if we can start bike sharing here as well.  

#### Additional Visualizations:
- Age Median Layer viz has been added to the challenge. Here geographic data is being viewed along with the age median layer to give a better understanding of the population.
